# Introduction

The methodology for accelerating applications on FPGA comprises of two phases: architecting the application and developing the accelerator to meet your desired performance goals.

* In the first phase, the developer makes key decisions about the architecture of the application and determines factors, such as what software functions should be mapped to FPGA kernels, how much parallelism is needed, and how it should be delivered.
* In the second phase, the developer implements the kernel by modifying the source code and applying pragmas to create kernel architecture that can achieve the desired performance goals.

You begin this tutorial with a baseline application and profile to examine the potential for hardware acceleration. The tutorial application involves searching an incoming stream of documents to find the documents that closely match a user’s interest based on a search profile using a bloom filter.

In general, this application has use cases in data analytics, such as browsing through unstructured data of emails and text files to identify the documents that closely associate with a specific user and send notifications accordingly.


# Before You Begin

The labs in this tutorial use:

* BASH Linux shell commands.
* 2019.2 Vitis core development kit release and the *xilinx_u200_xdma_201830_2* platform. If necessary, it can be easily ported to other versions and platforms.
* A `Makefile` that is detailed and contains many steps and variables. For a discussion of the `Makefile` structure and contents, refer to [Understanding the Makefile](./HowToRunTutorial.md).

>**IMPORTANT:**  
>
> * Before running any of the examples, make sure you have installed the Vitis core development kit as described in [Installation](https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/xilinx2019_2/vitis_doc/vhc1571429852245.html).
>* If you run applications on Xilinx® Alveo™ Data Center accelerator cards, ensure the card and software drivers have been correctly installed by following the instructions in the *Getting Started with Alveo Data Center Accelerator Cards Guide* ([UG1301](https://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/boards_and_kits/accelerator-cards/ug1301-getting-started-guide-alveo-accelerator-cards.pdf)).

## Accessing the Tutorial Reference Files

1. To access the reference files, enter the following in a terminal: `git clone http://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-Tutorials`.
2. Navigate to the `bloom` directory and then access the `design` directory.

## Tutorial Overview

1. [Brief overview of the Application](): 
2. [Experience Acceleration performance vs Software-only version]():
3. [Accelerating the Appplication](experience-the-acceleration.md)():
4. [Implementing the Kernel]():
5. [Data movement between Host and Kernel](data-movement.md):



[Evaluating the Original Application](original.md): In this lab, the original C++ based application computes scores for the documents using a bloom filter. This lab also discusses setting realistic performance goals for an accelerated application.
2. [Creating a Vitis Core Development Kit Application from the C Application](baseline_fpga.md): Convert the original C code into a host program and hardware kernel that is called by the host using the OpenCL™ API.
3. [Optimizing Memory Transfers](localbuf.md): Learn methods for optimizing the hardware kernel for improved memory access. You will learn how to use local cache to efficiently use the FPGA bandwidth.
4. [Optimizing with Dataflow](dataflow.md): Improve the compute efficiency of your kernel, applying dataflow and streaming to improve the datapath in your kernel.
5. [Using Out-of-Order Queues and Multiple Compute Units](multicu.md): Modify the OpenCL API calls in the host program to allow for out-of-order task execution and increase parallelism on the accelerator by synthesizing multiple kernels to perform the work.
6. [Optimizing with Multiple DDR Banks](multiddr.md): Modify the makefile for kernel connectivity to DDR banks and modify the host program to properly allocate the input documents to different DDR Banks.
7. [Running the Accelerator in Hardware](runningonhardware.md): All the previous steps have been run in Hardware Emulation mode. Here you run the application on the acceleration hardware.
